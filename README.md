# Web Development </br>
A tiny pet project to highlight the courses and projects I've worked on during my Master's program at USC in the form 
of a website. </br>
Learned some HTML, CSS and Javascript and used the Bootstrap framework. </br>
Found a source code for the template online and modified according to my application.
